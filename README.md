# Clinical Trial Optimization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores AI applications to **streamline clinical trial processes** and **enhance drug efficacy assessment**. The goal is to use **machine learning** to identify inefficiencies, predict patient dropout risks, and optimize trial scheduling.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) or synthetic datasets
- Data includes patient demographics, trial phases, dropout rates, and drug response metrics.

## 🛠 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning missing values, normalizing data, and extracting useful features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying inefficiencies in trial processes (e.g., patient dropout patterns).
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Using **logistic regression**, **random forest**, and **XGBoost** to predict patient adherence.
4. **Optimization**: Implementing **reinforcement learning** or **Bayesian optimization** to improve trial schedules.
5. **Visualization**: Developing an interactive **Plotly/Dash dashboard** to present insights.

## 🚀 Results
- Key findings on patient dropout trends
- AI-based predictions for trial efficiency improvement
